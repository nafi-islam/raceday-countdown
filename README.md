# Raceday Countdown üèéÔ∏è

## Inspiration

During my run at Tesla, I met countless diehard fans of [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/). This obsession trickled down to me and as a new fan, I am constantly trying to keep up with the sport. This web app is a simple way for me to document what's happening and my growing knowledge.

**Note: This project is still in development.**

## What It Does

This application was a spur of the moment idea I had when I missed the [2024 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/video.top-10-onboard-moments-2024-saudi-arabian-grand-prix.1793240439979961206.html). Being a busy student means that I often can't tune into worldwide races, so what better way for me to get a summary of what happened and when the next race will be.

## Development Thought Process

I am a huge of React.js as it's a powerful web framework that allows me to build web apps quickly. This application is your standard web app comprised of Javascript, HTML, and CSS with React. The API I'm using is the [Ergast API](https://ergast.com/mrd/) which is a jam-packed API that provides a ton of data related to F1. Unfortunately, it will not be supported after this season, so I will most likely have to switch over to the [FastF1 API](https://docs.fastf1.dev/). Bright side -- this gives me more time to flesh out this project before migrating.

## What's next?

- Read API Docs to see what features I can implement to make the application more robust.
- Update the frontend to make it more user-friendly and spice it up overall.
- In the future, I would love to make a predicition model implemented into this app.
